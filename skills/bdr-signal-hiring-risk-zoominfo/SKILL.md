name: bdr-signal-hiring-risk-zoominfo
description: >
  ZoomInfo variant of the Risk & Regulatory Hiring signal. Detects ICP-fit companies actively
  hiring for Risk & Regulatory roles — regulatory change, risk transformation, financial crime /
  AML / KYC / sanctions, operational risk, internal audit, controls testing, regulatory reporting,
  model risk, and similar. Fetches the same company ICP criteria and risk keyword list from the
  team's Notion reference page that the Apollo version uses, finds ICP companies in ZoomInfo,
  detects hiring via ZoomInfo Scoops (Open Position / Hiring Plans scoop types) instead of a
  job-postings endpoint, then surfaces ICP-matching contacts (CRO, CCO, Head of Financial Crime,
  Head of Regulatory Change, etc.) at those companies as leads for the Inbound (Leads) module.
  Output is a JSON payload ready for the zoho-crud-lead skill. Built to run side-by-side with
  bdr-signal-hiring-risk (Apollo) for a data-provider comparison.
  Use when asked to find companies hiring for risk, compliance, regulatory, or financial crime
  roles via ZoomInfo, run the ZoomInfo risk hiring signal scan, or compare ZoomInfo vs Apollo on
  risk hiring signals.
  Triggers on: "run zoominfo risk hiring signal scan", "which ICP companies are hiring for risk
  per zoominfo", "zoominfo risk hiring signal", "zoominfo who's hiring AML/KYC",
  "bdr-signal-hiring-risk-zoominfo".
  Every run renders the standardized Notion output template, computes live signal/source
  coverage from the Signal & Source Library, logs the run to the Skill Runs database, and
  posts a summary to Teams.

# Eclipse BDR — Signal: Company Hiring (Risk & Regulatory) — ZoomInfo

Surface ICP-fit companies with active **Risk & Regulatory** hiring — regulatory change, financial
crime / AML / KYC, operational risk, audit, controls, regulatory reporting, model risk — using
**ZoomInfo** as the data provider, then find ICP contacts at those companies. The structured JSON
payload hands off to `zoho-crud-lead` to write to Inbound (Leads); the user-facing deliverable is
the templated report (see 📐 Output Standard below).

> **Signal coverage:** computed fresh from the Signal Library on every run — never hardcoded.
> Every run ends with the standardized report, a Skill Runs log entry in Notion, and a Teams
> summary. See **📐 Output Standard** below.

This is the ZoomInfo twin of `bdr-signal-hiring-risk` (Apollo), and the Risk & Regulatory sibling
of `bdr-signal-hiring-data-zoominfo`. Same criteria page, same scoring rubric, same output shape —
only the data-provider layer differs, so the two can be run on the same criteria and diffed.

---

## ⚠️ Criteria Reference Page

This is the **same** reference page the Apollo risk-hiring skill uses — targeting criteria are
provider-agnostic. Always fetch it fresh — never use cached values.

**Reference (Notion) — Skill References - Signal: Company Hiring (Risk):**
`https://app.notion.com/p/6ce4e4751c3a8331828b818f9efe37b4`
(in the **Skill References** database)

Fetch fresh via the Notion MCP `notion-fetch` tool on every run.

Provides:
- **Section A — ICP Company & Contact Criteria:** `titles`, `seniority`, `industries`,
  `company_size`, `geography`, `include_similar_titles`
- **Section B — Risk Role Keywords:** `risk_role_keywords` (job title keywords to match against
  hiring scoops), optional financial-risk keyword list (only if enabled on the page), and
  `min_postings`

If the reference page is unreachable or empty, stop and tell the user. Do not proceed with
guessed or hardcoded criteria or keywords.

---

## 💳 Credits Note

`search_companies`, `search_scoops`, and `search_contacts` count toward ZoomInfo request/record
limits but are not bulk-credit enrichments. Like the Apollo version, this skill leaves `Email`
and `Phone` **null** — it does not call `enrich_contacts` (which would burn bulk credits). If the
team wants emails/phones populated, that's a separate, credit-consuming enrichment pass to add
later. Flag this in the run summary so nobody assumes contactability data is present.

---

## Step 1: Fetch Criteria

**From Section A**, extract: `titles`, `seniority`, `industries`, `company_size`, `geography`,
`include_similar_titles`.

**From Section B**, extract:
- `risk_role_keywords` — keywords to match against hiring-scoop descriptions / job titles
  (case-insensitive substring match). Include the optional financial-risk list only if the page
  says it is enabled.
- `min_postings` — minimum number of matching hiring scoops to qualify a company as a "hiring
  signal" (default: `1` if not specified)

---

## Step 1b: Resolve ZoomInfo Lookup Values

ZoomInfo search fails on free-text filter values — it needs canonical IDs. Before searching,
call `lookup` to translate Section A criteria into ZoomInfo values:

| Section A field | `lookup` fieldName | Used in |
|---|---|---|
| `industries` | `industries` (use `fuzzyMatch`) | `industryCodes` |
| `geography` | `metro-regions` or `states` (use `fuzzyMatch`) | `metroRegion` / `state` |
| `company_size` | `employee-count` | `employeeCount` |

Use the returned `id` values (not `attributes.name`) in the searches below.

---

## Step 2: Find ICP Companies Hiring for Risk Roles

ZoomInfo has **no job-postings endpoint**. Its native hiring surface is **Scoops** — specifically
the `Open Position` and `Hiring Plans` scoop types. Use `search_scoops`, which accepts the ICP
company filters and the hiring filters in one call:

| Source | `search_scoops` parameter |
|---|---|
| `scoopTypes` | `["Open Position", "Hiring Plans"]` |
| `industryCodes` (resolved in 1b) | `industryCodes` |
| `employeeCount` (resolved in 1b) | `employeeCount` |
| `geography` (resolved in 1b) | `metroRegions` / `state` |
| `risk_role_keywords` (Section B) | `description` (space-separated keywords) and/or `jobTitle` |
| department | `department: ["Finance", "Legal", "Operations"]` |

Fixed parameters:
- `pageSize`: 25, `sort`: `-originalPublishedDate` (freshest hiring activity first)

> Note on `department`: ZoomInfo's scoop departments don't carry a dedicated "Risk/Compliance"
> value — risk, compliance, and financial-crime roles scatter across Finance, Legal, and
> Operations. Treat `department` as a soft hint only; **keyword matching against
> `risk_role_keywords` is the primary filter.** If the department filter suppresses obvious
> matches, drop it and rely on keywords alone.

A scoop **matches** if its description / job title contains any keyword from `risk_role_keywords`
(case-insensitive substring). Group matching scoops by company. Keep only companies where the
count of matching scoops ≥ `min_postings`. These are your **hiring signal companies**.

> Alternative (higher precision, higher cost): for a known target-account list, call
> `enrich_scoops` per company with the same `scoopTypes` + `description` filters instead of a
> broad `search_scoops`. Note it consumes a credit per company.

Capture each hiring signal company's `zoominfoCompanyId` for Step 3.

---

## Step 3: Find ICP Contacts at Hiring Signal Companies

For each hiring signal company, call `search_contacts`:

| Section A field | `search_contacts` parameter |
|---|---|
| company | `companyId` (the `zoominfoCompanyId` from Step 2) |
| `titles` | `jobTitle` (OR-joined) if `include_similar_titles` is true; else `exactJobTitle` |
| `seniority` → management level | `managementLevel` (e.g. `"C Level Exec,VP Level Exec,Director"`) |

Fixed parameters:
- `pageSize`: 10 per company (surface the best matches, not an exhaustive list)
- `sort`: `-contactAccuracyScore` (most reachable first)

Capture per contact: `personId`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `jobTitle`, `managementLevel`,
`companyName`, `externalUrls` (LinkedIn), `contactAccuracyScore`. Leave email/phone null (see
Credits Note).

---

## Step 4: Score Results

For each person returned, score Eclipse relevance 1–10. **Identical rubric to the Apollo version**
so scores are directly comparable.

| Condition | Points |
|---|---|
| Company is a bank or credit union | +3 |
| Company is an asset/investment manager or PE firm | +2 |
| Company is a fintech, payments, or insurance firm | +1 |
| Person is C-suite (CRO, CCO, CDO, CIO, CTO) | +3 |
| Person is VP-level | +2 |
| Person is Director-level | +1 |
| Company has ≥ 2 matching hiring scoops (program build, not a single backfill) | +1 |
| Company has 1,000–10,000 employees | +1 |
| No company size data available | -1 |

**ICP match:** `true` if score ≥ 5.

**ICP role match:**
- C-suite risk/compliance title → `"Primary ICP"`
- VP or Director risk/compliance title → `"Secondary ICP"`

---

## Step 5: Build CRM Payload

For every result with `icp_match: true`, build one lead record for the Inbound (Leads) module.

Field mapping:

| Generic | Zoho API Name | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `first_name` | `First_Name` | |
| `last_name` | `Last_Name` | |
| `title` | `Designation` | |
| `company` | `Company` | |
| `email` | `Email` | Null — not enriched (see Credits Note) |
| `phone` | `Phone` | Null — not enriched (see Credits Note) |
| `linkedin_url` | `LinkedIn_Page_URL` | From `externalUrls` |
| `employee_count` | `No_of_Employees` | |
| `industry` | `Industry` | Map to closest Zoho picklist value |
| `practice_areas` | `Practice_Areas_In_Scope` | `["Risk & Regulatory"]` — additionally include `"Financial Crimes & Compliance"` when the company's matched scoops include financial crime keywords (AML, BSA, KYC, Sanctions, Financial Crime, Transaction Monitoring) |
| `lead_source` | `Lead_Source` | Always `"ZoomInfo ICP Scan"` ⚡ (value pending team addition) |
| `zoominfo_contact_id` | `ZoomInfo_Contact_ID_c` | ⚡ Field pending team creation (ZoomInfo `personId`) |
| `signal_type` | `Signal_Type_c` | Always `"Company Hiring"` ⚡ Field pending team creation |
| `signal_date` | `Signal_Date_c` | Today's date ⚡ Field pending team creation |
| `signal_summary` | `Signal_Summary_c` | Generated in Step 6 ⚡ Field pending team creation |

⚡ = custom field not yet created. Include in payload regardless — `zoho-crud-lead` will skip ⚡
fields gracefully until they exist in Zoho.

**Dedup field:** `ZoomInfo_Contact_ID_c`. Dedup fallback: `First_Name + Last_Name + Company`.

> ⚠️ **Integration touchpoint:** `zoho-crud-lead` currently keys dedup on `Apollo_Contact_ID_c`.
> This payload uses `ZoomInfo_Contact_ID_c`. The CRM writer must be taught the new dedup key (or
> dedup on the name+company fallback) before these leads write cleanly alongside Apollo-sourced
> ones. Surface this in the run summary; do not silently assume it round-trips.

---

## Step 6: Generate Signal Summary

For each lead record, write a `signal_summary` (2 sentences max):

> "[Company] is actively hiring for Risk & Regulatory roles ([list matched scoop titles, max 3]).
> [First name] is [title] there — surfaced via ZoomInfo as a Risk & Regulatory signal on [date]."

If the matched scoops are predominantly financial crime roles (AML, BSA, KYC, Sanctions,
Financial Crime, Transaction Monitoring), note it:

> "[Company] is staffing a financial crime compliance program ([list matched scoop titles, max 3]).
> [First name] is [title] there — surfaced via ZoomInfo as a Risk & Regulatory signal on [date]."

---

## Step 7: Return JSON

Assemble this JSON payload — it feeds the Skill Runs log (embedded in the run page's toggle
block) and the downstream `zoho-crud-lead` handoff. The user-facing deliverable is the
templated report plus the Skill Runs log entry and Teams summary (see 📐 Output Standard).

- IDs sequential: `lead_001`, `lead_002`, etc.
- `meta` block is for human review only — not written to Zoho
- If no hiring signals found: return empty `leads: []` and `hiring_signal_companies: []`

## ZoomInfo vs Apollo — what to compare

When run against the same criteria as `bdr-signal-hiring-risk`, compare:
- **Company coverage** — does ZoomInfo surface risk/compliance hiring at banks and insurers the
  Apollo postings endpoint misses? (Per Nico's research, ZoomInfo is expected to win on
  financial-industry and large-enterprise coverage — the core market for this signal.)
- **Signal mechanism** — Apollo reads live job postings; ZoomInfo reads research-curated Scoops
  (`Open Position` / `Hiring Plans`). Scoops may lag live postings but carry ZoomInfo's
  human-verified context.
- **Financial-crime precision** — compare how cleanly each provider isolates AML/KYC/sanctions
  hiring (the highest-value sub-signal) from general risk roles.
- **Contact match + accuracy** — ZoomInfo returns a `contactAccuracyScore` per contact; Apollo
  masks some last names. Compare fill quality.

## 📐 Output Standard (mandatory — every run)

Every run of this skill ends by rendering a standardized report, logging the run to Notion, and
posting a summary to Microsoft Teams. Nothing in this section is hardcoded: signal coverage,
source scoring, and the report format are all fetched fresh from Notion on every run.

### A. Fetch the output template (format authority)

Fetch this page fresh at the start of every run (Notion MCP `notion-fetch`):

**Output Template — Company Signals & Contacts** —
`https://app.notion.com/p/3914e4751c3a81f3b5c9f379246f54dc`
(in the **Skill References** database)

The rendered run report must follow that page exactly — its Run Header, Sources Used table,
Findings blocks, Run Summary, Skill Runs logging spec, and Teams summary spec. If the URL fails,
locate the page with `notion-search` (query: `"Output Template — Company Signals & Contacts"`).
If it is still unavailable, render the report with the same section order (Header → Sources →
Findings → Summary) and flag in the output that the template could not be fetched.

### B. Compute signal coverage (never hardcode)

This skill's detection mechanism: active Risk & Regulatory hiring (regulatory change, financial
crime / AML / KYC, operational risk, audit, controls, regulatory reporting, model risk) at
ICP-fit companies, via ZoomInfo Scoops (Open Position / Hiring Plans scoop types).

Resolve which Signal Library signals this run covers — fresh, on every run:

1. Query the **Signal Library** data source
   (`collection://3904e475-1c3a-8085-8c1e-000b40a34f87`, on the **02_Signal & Source Library**
   page `https://app.notion.com/p/3904e4751c3a80b98da7c6bac9ca34c7`) with `notion-search` scoped
   via `data_source_url`, using this skill's own name (`bdr-signal-hiring-risk-zoominfo`) and
   these coverage terms: "risk hiring", "compliance hiring", "financial crime", "AML / KYC",
   "regulatory change", "model risk". (SQL via `notion-query-data-sources` is plan-gated on this
   workspace — do not rely on it.)
2. `notion-fetch` each candidate row. A row is **covered** if its Skill Coverage property
   (currently named `TEMP - Skill Coverage`) names this skill, or its `Signal Definition` /
   `Observable Evidence` clearly matches the detection mechanism above.
3. Render the header line `**Coverage:** SIG-0XX — <Signal Name>; …` and keep each covered row's
   **Why It Matters**, **Hidden Hypothesis**, **Eclipse Wedge**, **Recommended Disposition**, and
   **Target Personas** — the report's Findings blocks must be grounded in these fields, not in
   invented framing.

If no row matches, render `**Coverage:** none mapped in Signal Library` and flag it for the team
in the report and the Teams summary.

### C. Compute source & source-type scoring (never hardcode)

For every source actually consulted this run (the ZoomInfo platform: Scoops search + contact
search), build the template's **Sources Used** table:

1. Resolve the source in the **Source Catalog**
   (`collection://2485d7c1-f09c-46a4-abed-e6991c6932d8`) by `Source URL` or `Source Name`
   (scoped `notion-search`, then `notion-fetch` the row) → get its `SRC-0XX` Source ID.
2. Follow the row's **Source Type** relation into **Source Type Scoring**
   (`collection://3904e475-1c3a-809b-92f8-000b78de539f`) and report the Source Type plus its
   **Default Confidence Score**, **Default Source Reliability**, and **Default Signal Strength**.
   If the Source Catalog row carries its own `Source Reliability` / `Default Source Strength`,
   those per-source values override the type defaults.
3. A consulted source with no Source Catalog row is still listed, flagged `⚠️ uncataloged`, with
   best-judgment scores and a note asking the team to add it to the Source Catalog.

Cache these lookups within a run (one lookup per distinct source) — never across runs.

### D. Log the run to Skill Runs (Notion — mandatory, test runs included)

Create one page per run in the **Skill Runs** database
(`https://app.notion.com/p/3874e4751c3a8084a89be17b28e4c6a1`, data source
`collection://3874e475-1c3a-80a1-8ed7-000ba308ec09`) via `notion-create-pages`:

- **Name:** `bdr-signal-hiring-risk-zoominfo — <YYYY-MM-DD> — <short descriptor of the outcome>`
- **Select:** `bdr-signal-hiring-risk-zoominfo`
- **Multi-select:** provider(s) actually used this run (`Zoominfo`)
- **Type:** `live run` (or `test run` for dry runs / tests)
- **Page body:** the full rendered report from section A, followed by a toggle block containing
  the run's raw JSON output.

Keep the created page's URL — the Teams summary links to it.

### E. Post the run summary to Teams (mandatory)

Compose the short summary exactly per the template's Teams section (bold headline, 1-sentence
outcome, top-3 bullets, link to the Skill Runs page) and deliver it by invoking the
**bdr-post-to-teams** skill. Post even when the run found nothing — a clean-scan note with the
coverage line is still a result.

---

## Eclipse Context

**Practice area:** Risk & Regulatory Change (including Financial Crime Compliance).

**Signal:** A company actively hiring for risk, compliance, regulatory change, or financial crime
roles is responding to pressure — regulatory expectations, audit findings, remediation timelines,
or a funded program build-out. Per the ICP & Buyer Persona Analysis, strong-fit indicators include
active regulatory/audit/compliance pressure, large-scale risk or compliance change initiatives,
AML/KYC modernization, and manual controls, testing, or reporting processes.

**Eclipse wedge:** Regulatory remediation planning, financial crime compliance support (AML, KYC,
transaction monitoring), controls design & testing, risk data & reporting alignment, audit
readiness & issue remediation, and operating model design for risk & compliance — plus financial
risk (credit, liquidity, market, valuation) and non-financial risk (operational, technology,
third-party, model risk) offerings.

**Relationship to siblings:** Same detection mechanism as `bdr-signal-hiring-data-zoominfo`,
different practice. Same output shape and `zoho-crud-lead` handoff as the Apollo
`bdr-signal-hiring-risk`; each reads its own client-managed Notion reference page.
